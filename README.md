## Structure of the app :
three-tier architecture :
- `The Presentation Tier` : ’Front end’ of the project, positioned at the uppermost level of the application, this tier focuses on presenting information to the user and translating tasks as well as results
into a user-friendly format.
- `The Application Tier` :  ’Back end’ of the project, serving as the heart of the application, this tier coordinates and controls the system. This tier shuttles and processes data between the two other tiers.
- `The Data Tier` : This final layer is dedicated to data persistence, where it stores and retrieves information from a database.

## Execution:
- Once the application is running, you can access it on the Spring Boot server at `[http://localhost:8080]` using your web browser.
- The code to be executed is in the `main` branch.
- The login credentials for accessing the application are as follows: the email is `test` and the password is `123`. 

`NB : The connection to the database is established successfully using the INSA server.`
